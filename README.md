# THE BONEKEST DUNGEON

Boneky is a mighty undead mage, who is seeking more power in the deepest dungeon of the world. Trying to acquire it he has to make his way through the enchanted maze. But he must be vigilant because the ancient evil can bonk him from the shadows.

### INSTRUCTIONS

In order to win the game, you need to find three keys hidden in the maze. Once you get all of the keys you will need to find the exit portal.

The maze is a matrix. On the top of the screen, you can find the room coordinates that you’re currently in. It consists of two numbers which represent the X and Y axis.

When you start a level a monster is spawned somewhere in the dungeon.  Every time you go through a portal connecting two rooms the monster moves into the neighbour room as well. If you meet the monster in a room that you decided to visit you will lose a life.

You can use magic in order to find which room the monster is hiding in right now and plan your way accordingly.
